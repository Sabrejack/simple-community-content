# Simple Content
This data is a collection of simulations and scripts, along with configurations to help them run, meant to be used with [Simple](https://pistolshrimpgames.github.io/pages/simple/simple.html). Included is some tutorial data which provides a jumping-off point, but Melee data for [UQM2](https://pistolshrimpgames.com/uqm2/), which is fairly complex, will be added shortly. On its own, the content is mostly files stored in JSON and will not be meaningfully legible or mergeable by humans.

# How do I use the content?
Just place the content inside your `game/` subdirectory alongside your Simple installation, then open any of the `.sim` files.

# What am I allowed to do with this?
The content is licensed under the BSD license, permitting you to use and redistribute it as you see fit. Beyond the boring legalese, we hope you have fun remixing this content, forking your own set of data, sharing it, playing it with other people, or even showing us the cool things youâ€™ve done with it!
