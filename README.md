# Simple Content

This data is a collection of simulations and scripts, along with configurations to help them run, meant to be used with [Simple](https://pistolshrimpgames.github.io/pages/simple/simple.html). Included is some tutorial data which provides a jumping-off point, but Melee data for the in-development [The Ur-Quan Masters 2](https://pistolshrimpgames.com/uqm2/), which is fairly complex, is included at `sim/ships/melee.sim`. On its own, the content is mostly files stored in JSON to be read/written by Simple and will not be meaningfully legible or mergeable on its own.

# How do I use the content?

Just place the content inside your `game/` subdirectory alongside your Simple installation, then open any of the `.sim` files. If you're new to Simple, see [the quick start guide](https://pistolshrimpgames.github.io/pages/simple/quickstart/simple_quickstart_1.html).
